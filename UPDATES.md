# Updates

Changelog for claude-code-skills. Newest first.

## 2026-04-04

### Added: Principle 11 - Research Pipeline
- Save research results to `.research/incoming/` after every research session
- Prevents duplicate work across sessions
- Creates a knowledge pipeline: research -> incoming -> review -> knowledge base
- Connected to Codified Context, Session Handoff, Autoresearch principles

### Rewritten: README.md

Repositioned from "skills collection" to "configuration system for Claude Code agents". Focus on: what problems each principle solves (not abstract descriptions), alternatives as key feature (agent picks the right approach), security hardening section, principles by maturity level (L1-L3). Skills described as secondary/reference implementations.

### Added: Session Handoff comparison (Alternative)

Five approaches to seamless session transitions compared: Manual HANDOFF.md, Stop Hook (auto), Session Journal (living log), ContextHarness (framework), Memory Only (baseline). Sources: claude-handoff plugin, ContextHarness, JD Hodges patterns, GitHub issue #11455 community patterns.

Key insight: structured handoff (500-2000 tokens) beats raw conversation dump (50-100K tokens) by ~50x compression with higher signal. "What did NOT work" is the most valuable section - prevents the next session from repeating dead ends.

See [alternatives/session-handoff.md](alternatives/session-handoff.md).

### Added: Research evidence to Codified Context (Principle 07)

Two contradictory studies on context files (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md): one shows -28.6% task time, other shows -3% success rate. Resolution: auto-generated context hurts, human-written non-inferable knowledge helps. Added "The Rule" - only include what the agent cannot derive from reading the code. ETH Zurich data: LLM-generated context = +20% cost, +2-4 extra reasoning steps.

### Added: Principle Map by Reasoning Level to README

Three-level taxonomy (arxiv 2601.12538, 2504.19678) maps to our 10 principles: L1 Foundational (single agent), L2 Self-Evolving (feedback + memory), L3 Collective (multi-agent). Helps users pick which principles to adopt first.

### Updated: Structured Reasoning accuracy to 93% (Principle 05)

Paper v2 results on real-world agent-generated patches: 78% -> 93% accuracy.

### Added: axios@1.14.1 case study to Supply Chain Defense (Principle 09)

Real-world supply chain attack on the official `axios` npm package (~100M weekly downloads), attributed to DPRK-nexus threat actor UNC1069 by Google Threat Intelligence. Maintainer account hijacked, RAT deployed via postinstall hook. Exposure window: ~3 hours. `min-release-age=7` would have completely blocked the attack. Full timeline, attack chain, defense matrix, and IOCs documented. Sources: Elastic Security Labs, Snyk, Wiz, Google Cloud Blog.

### Added: Revision Trajectories + problems.md schema to Proof Loop (Principle 02)

Based on Agent-R (arxiv 2501.11425): failed-then-fixed trajectories are more valuable than clean passes. Added structured Evaluator feedback format (cut point + reflection + direction) and a concrete `problems.md` schema with criterion ID, reproduction steps, expected vs actual, affected files, and smallest safe fix. Improves the fix -> verify again cycle.

### Fixed: README principle count (9 -> 10)

README.md listed "9 architectural principles" and was missing Principle 10 (Agent Security) from the principles table. Updated to reflect all 10 principles.

### Added: "Deletion = re-verification" rule to Anti-Fabrication

Added the pattern: after executing a delete command, always verify the object is actually gone. Commands can exit 0 without doing anything (permissions, locks, wrong path). Part of the Anti-Fabrication section in Deterministic Orchestration.

### Added: Agent Security (Principle 10)

Comprehensive defense guide against prompt injection and adversarial attacks on AI coding agents. Covers 7 attack categories (in-code injection, repo metadata, package metadata, MCP tool poisoning, web content injection, memory poisoning, sandbox escape) with real CVEs and incidents. Six-layer defense architecture from content isolation to monitoring. See [principles/10-agent-security.md](principles/10-agent-security.md).

### Added: Supply Chain Defense (Principle 09)

Package age gating as defense against supply chain attacks. Two config lines that block packages published less than 7 days ago:

```ini
# ~/.npmrc
min-release-age=7
```

```toml
# ~/.config/uv/uv.toml
exclude-newer = "7 days"
```

Most malicious packages are caught within 1-3 days. The 7-day delay eliminates the attack window with near-zero friction to your workflow. See [principles/09-supply-chain-defense.md](principles/09-supply-chain-defense.md) for full details including per-manager configs, CI considerations, and defense-in-depth layers.

### Fixed: 6 skills were ZIP archives, not readable on GitHub

`diffusion-engineering`, `vlm-segmentation`, `flux2-klein-prompting`, `forensic-prompt-compiler`, `ios-development`, `frontend-design` - all now properly extracted with SKILL.md + references/ as readable markdown.

### Updated: Memento references replaced

The `mderk/memento` repo appears to have been removed from GitHub. All references updated to point to active alternatives: [task-orchestrator](https://github.com/jpicklyk/task-orchestrator), [inngest/agent-kit](https://github.com/inngest/agent-kit). The deterministic orchestration principles remain valid and well-documented.

### Freshness check: all 10 concepts reviewed

| Concept | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Generator-Evaluator | Current - now a standard primitive |
| Proof Loop | Current - watch formal verification + LLM space |
| Autoresearch | Very current - 21K stars, ecosystem explosion |
| HyperAgents | Current - Meta released code |
| HACRL | Current - conceptual pattern is actionable |
| Structured Reasoning | Current - 78%->88% accuracy validated |
| Codified Context | Current - 1M window adjusts urgency, not principle |
| Memento | Repo gone - principles live in alternatives |
| Context Engineering | Current - update for 1M context realities |
| Multi-Agent Decomposition | Current - trend toward adaptive routing |
